## Assignment
- Create a Memory Game 
    Goal: We are shuffling 10 images. Each image can be selected only once!

### Requirements:
- Use Hooks such as useState, useEffect, etc
- The game should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”
- There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.

## Learning outcomes from this project
- Get familiar with Hooks/Functional Components
- Learning about component lifecycle
